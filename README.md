## Motivation
My motivation for this project was to continue to learn React and gain more practice developing full stack applications. I have integrated a SQL database on the backend, and utilized AWS S3 to store static image data. Additionally, I wanted to practice my front-end development and design muscles. I utilized Figma to create the design of the landing page, then created each component using React.
